    "# Simulating and Visualizing Stock Prices Over a Year\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "This script generates and visualizes stock price trends for five stocks over a year (52 weeks). It calculates key summary statistics for each quarter.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "## Key Steps:\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "1. **Simulating Weekly Stock Prices**:\r\n",
    "   - Weekly returns for five stocks are simulated using a normal distribution\n",
    "     with a predefine.0025`) and standard de`0.05`).\r\n",
    "   - Prices are calculated using cumulative product of returns, starting from an initial value of 100.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "2. **Data Organization**:\r\n",
    "   - Prices are stored in a pandas DataFrame with stocks as rows and weeks as columns for easy manipulation and analysis.\r\n",
    "   - The DataFrame is later transposed to make weeks the rows for easier quarterly analysis.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "3. **Visualization**:\r\n",
    "   - A line plot is created to visualize stock price trends over the year.\r\n",
    "   - Each line represents a stock, with a legend for identification.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "4. **Quarterly Statistics**:\r\n",
    "   - For each quarter (13 weeks), the following statistics are computed:\r\n",
    "     - **Minimum price**\r\n",
    "     - **Average price**\r\n",
    "     - **Maximum price**\r\n",
    "   - These statistics provide insights into the performance of the stocks during each quarter.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The script provides a comprehensive view of stock price behavior and key trends across four quarters.\r\n"
